### Hi there, I'm Kelvyn 🙋‍♂️

I'm a student of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm focused on learning cryptology, but I also really enjoy doing designs with frontend technologies. I don't practice professionally yet but I collaborate in public projects and participate in academic programming contests. That's why I have an account here😋.
